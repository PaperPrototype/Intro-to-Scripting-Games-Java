# Preview - TODO

last section talks about coloring shapes + making an owl. This section will use variables tomake the owls eyes grow!

end this section by saying "we haven't quite made a game yet tho. This sun of ours just bruns ours eyes out... a real sun would set, so we cna go to bed! 

If this were a game the sun would *do* something. We can actually simulate the sun mvoing by updating the picture on the screen every few milliseconds!" 

then draw function / loop... drawing a sun (in new project) inside of the draw/update function. "this is still boring cause even though we are drawing the sun over and over... it doesn't... move."

we need the sun to change. Lets control the size of the sun using a variable! 

And what happens if we increase that variable each time we draw the sun...

code for growing sun

An ever growing sun!!!
