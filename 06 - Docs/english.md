# Preview - TODO

So you've made a few programs, and you might start to wonder how your going to remember all this stuff.

Well thankfully, most programmers don't. Instead, some of the best programmers are REALLY good at using what's called "the docs".

Basically they are a list of all the commands you can use, and how to use them!

Below we've made a simplified "doc". 

# Simple Docs

## Color
`background(red, green, blue)`

Sets the color used for the background of the Processing window

```java
// set color to red
background(255, 0, 0);
```

`fill(red, green, blue)`

Sets the color used to fill shapes

```java
// fill all shapes with green
fill(0, 255, 0);

// fill all shapes with blue
fill(0, 0, 255);
```

`stroke(red, green, blue)`

Sets the color used to draw the stroke (outline) around shapes

```java
// set outline color to red
stroke()
```

`strokeWeight(width)`

## Shapes


For the the full list of docs see processings official website has much more thorough documentation.
