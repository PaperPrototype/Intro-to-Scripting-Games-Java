Teach interfaces... = hold stuff in an array, and know which functions they have.

Hold onto any type of item that can have a move + render methods... cars, plain face dude, and boats. Implement GameThing interface.

end with, "by tradition we name an Interface with an uppercase I in the front. So lets rname GameThing to IGameThing".
