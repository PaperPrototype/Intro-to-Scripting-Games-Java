# Preview - TODO

last section talks about coloring shapes + making an owl. This section will use variables to move the owl around, without having to edit every single position!

end this section by saying "we haven't quite made a game yet tho. This owl of ours just stares at us like a painting... games *do* stuff and our players *move*. That is simulated by updating the picture on the screen every few milliseconds." 

then draw function / loop... drawing a sun (in new project) inside of the draw/update function. "this is still boring cause even though we are drawing the sun over and over... it doesn't... move."

we need the sun to change. Lets control the size of the sun using a variable! 

And what happens if we increase that variable each time we draw the sun...

code for growing sun

An ever growing sun!!!
