last section talked about making the owls eyes grow forever using variables and the draw/update function. 

Now what if we control the owl's *position* using variables?

Once owl position controlled by variables, then use builtin mouse variable and move owl using mouse position!

Now its time to use the update function with builtin variables for getting the mouse position!
