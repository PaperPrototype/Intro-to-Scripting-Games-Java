# Challenge Draw an Owl...?

By the end you will have an owl... chicken.. thing.

Mr. Questionable Owl here is our subject of art today.

First lets set the background and size of the window.

```java
size(400, 400);
background(5, 5, 100);
```

If you run this you will see a blue background!

# Comments
Once you start writing lots of code it will get hard to know what code does what. So we have comments (that the computer will ingore).

![owl setup comment](/Assets/owl-setup-comment.png)

Comments start with 2 slashes `//` and are ingored by the computer. It is very important to comment code! If I don't comment my code I often forget what that code does! 

# Head
Now make the owls head, and comment the code!

# Eyes
And now for the eyes!

![owl eyes](/Assets/owl-eyes.png)

I left some of the numbers as `0000`. Fill in all the `0000`'s with the correct number!

# Pupil Color
We want the pupils to be mostly dark. So we are going to use a fill color of `(1, 1, 5)`. The smaller the numbers I use for RGB (Red Green Blue) the less bright the colors will be!

# Pupils
We left the numbers for the right eye's pupil positon and size as `0000`. Its your job to fill them in!

# Pupil outline
The owl's eyes look fabulous.

But they could be better! They really need some yellow around them. For this we can add an outline to the pupils.

We see 2 new commands here.

```java
stroke(red, green, blue);
```

The `stroke` command sets the color of the outline or "stroke" (as in a painting brush's stroke).

```java
strokeWeight(width);
```

The `strokeWeight` command sets the width of the stroke.

And now its your turn to add a mouth!

(Mr. Questionable Owl)

If you don't want Mr. Questionable owl to become a susy owl (with yellow lips) use the `strokeWeight` command to set the outline width, right before drawing the mouth.

Lets save this wonderful project's code (and owl)...

# Saving on Windows
